You are given a binary string 𝑠 (recall that a string is binary if each character is either 0 or 1).

Let 𝑓(𝑡) be the decimal representation of integer 𝑡 written in binary form (possibly with leading zeroes). For example 𝑓(011)=3,𝑓(00101)=5,𝑓(00001)=1,𝑓(10)=2,𝑓(000)=0 and 𝑓(000100)=4.

The substring 𝑠𝑙,𝑠𝑙+1,…,𝑠𝑟 is good if 𝑟−𝑙+1=𝑓(𝑠𝑙…𝑠𝑟).

For example string 𝑠=1011 has 5 good substrings: 𝑠1…𝑠1=1, 𝑠3…𝑠3=1, 𝑠4…𝑠4=1, 𝑠1…𝑠2=10 and 𝑠2…𝑠4=011.

Your task is to calculate the number of good substrings of string 𝑠.

You have to answer 𝑡 independent queries.

Input
The first line contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of queries.

The only line of each query contains string 𝑠 (1≤|𝑠|≤2⋅105), consisting of only digits 0 and 1.

It is guaranteed that ∑𝑖=1𝑡|𝑠𝑖|≤2⋅105.

Output
For each query print one integer — the number of good substrings of string 𝑠.
